# RISC-V Emulator Project

## Overview

This project is a RISC-V emulator that simulates the execution of RISC-V instructions. It includes an assembler for converting RISC-V assembly code into machine code, and an emulator that executes this machine code. The emulator also features a basic Virtual File System (VFS) for file I/O operations.

## Components

1. **Assembler**: Converts RISC-V assembly code into binary machine code.
2. **Emulator**: Executes RISC-V machine code, simulating a RISC-V processor.
3. **Virtual File System (VFS)**: Provides basic file I/O operations within the emulated environment.

## Features

- Supports the RV32I base integer instruction set.
- Implements a simple in-memory Virtual File System.
- Provides detailed output of instruction execution and register states.
- Handles basic system calls for file operations.

## What I've Learned

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights and skills:

1. **RISC-V Architecture**: Deep understanding of the RISC-V instruction set and CPU architecture.
2. **Emulation Techniques**: Learned how to simulate a processor's behavior in software.
3. **Assembly and Machine Code**: Improved understanding of the relationship between assembly language and machine code.
4. **System Calls**: Implemented basic system calls, bridging the gap between user-level code and OS-level operations.
5. **Virtual File Systems**: Gained knowledge about how file systems work at a basic level.
6. **C Programming**: Enhanced C programming skills, especially in areas of bitwise operations and memory management.
7. **Software Architecture**: Learned to design and implement a complex system with multiple interacting components.

## How to Use

1. **Assembling RISC-V Code**:

```bash
./assembler input.s output.bin
```

2. **Running the Emulator**:
```bash
./emulator output.bin
```

## Project Structure

- `assembler.c`: RISC-V assembler implementation
- `emulator.c`: Main emulator code
- `vfs.c` & `vfs.h`: Virtual File System implementation
- `sample.s`: Sample RISC-V assembly code for testing

## Future Improvements

1. **Extended Instruction Support**: Implement additional RISC-V extensions (e.g., RV32M for multiplication).
2. **Improved VFS**: Enhance the Virtual File System with more advanced features like directories and file permissions.
3. **Memory Management**: Implement a more sophisticated memory model with different memory regions.
4. **Debugging Features**: Add breakpoint support and a step-through debugging mode.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Explore techniques like dynamic recompilation for faster emulation.
6. **GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction and visualization of the emulator's state.
7. **Interrupt Handling**: Implement interrupt and exception handling for a more realistic CPU simulation.
8. **Peripheral Emulation**: Add emulation of common peripherals like UART for console I/O.
9. **Multi-core Support**: Extend the emulator to support multi-core RISC-V configurations.
10. **Floating-Point Support**: Implement the RISC-V floating-point extensions.
